# upgrading

instructions for upgrading codex-web to point at a new version of upstream
Codex Desktop.

if `npm install` needs to download Electron, using a mirror is usually faster
and avoids upstream download failures:

```bash
ELECTRON_MIRROR="https://npmmirror.com/mirrors/electron/" npm install
```

## backing up

we will start by generating a scratch directory and backing it up. first, let's
get the `scratch` directory to a known state by running the following

```bash
rm -rf scratch scratch-backup # remove existing past scratch directories to start from clean state
DEV=1 nix develop --command yarn run prepare:asar
mv scratch scratch-backup
```

the `scratch-backup` directory holds the patched, working version of codex-web.
we will use this when moving the patches over to the new version to understand
the context the patches were being applied in.

## updating urls

there are a few places to update next.

1. `appVersion` in default.nix and `hash` in `codexZip`.
2. `APP_VERSION` in ./scripts/prepare

## from-zero adaptation pipeline

for a fresh upstream artifact, prefer the single entry point:

```bash
HOSTED_CODEX_APP_ZIP=/path/to/Codex.zip npm run adapt:desktop -- --prepare --smoke runtime
```

or, when the zip path should be passed explicitly:

```bash
npm run adapt:desktop -- --zip /path/to/Codex.zip --smoke runtime
```

the pipeline does the following:

1. unpacks the upstream app with `scripts/prepare_asar`.
2. generates `patches/webview-preload.patch` and
   `scratch/preload-hook-report.json` from the upstream artifacts.
3. fails if `support.ok` or `staticReview.ok` is not true.
4. builds browser assets, including `webview/assets/preload.js`.
5. runs the focused patch/static tests.
6. runs the preload smoke probe.

runtime smoke loads the generated `webview/index.html` in an Electron renderer
and checks the preload bridge over CDP. on Linux, it needs `DISPLAY`,
`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, or an xvfb wrapper.
in a non-graphical environment, run the same gate with preflight smoke:

```bash
npm run adapt:desktop -- --smoke preflight
```

`--smoke preflight` still verifies the generated preload report, patched
`webview/index.html`, generated `webview/assets/preload.js`, and executes that
preload bundle in a VM with browser/Electron shims. it does not launch Electron.
use `--smoke runtime` before calling the upgrade complete.

the report gate is intentionally strict. if it fails, inspect:

```bash
node -e 'const r=require("./scratch/preload-hook-report.json"); console.log(r.support, r.staticReview)'
```

all static review arrays must be empty:

- `unknownRendererArguments`
- `unresolvedBridgeReturns`
- `unresolvedIpcPayloads`
- `unsupportedBridgeMethodCalls`

then temporarily comment out the patch lines in ./scripts/prepare_asar and run

```bash
DEV=1 nix develop --command yarn run prepare:asar
cp -r scratch scratch-new-version-unmodified
```

## upgrading the codex-cli version

this part can be run concurrently with the rest of the upgrade process. make
sure to wait for its completion before doing validation. run it in a subagent.

run the following to get the version of the new codex-cli

```bash
scratch/Codex.app/Contents/Resources/codex --version
```

then update the `nix/codex/default.nix` file's `version` field and hashes to
point to the new version.

## porting over patches

now we have a few folders

- `scratch-backup`: patches applied on top of old version of Codex Desktop
- `scratch-new-version-unmodified`: plain extracted new version of Codex Desktop
- `scratch`: working copy we will be modifying

now carefully look at the patches in `patches/` and how they were applied in
`scratch-backup` and bring the changes over to `scratch`. apply them directly
in-tree first. don't worry immediately about updating the patches yet.

## updating patches

once the patches have been made in `scratch`, diff the changes in `scratch`
against `scratch-new-version-unmodified` and update the patches in `patches/`.
always generate the patches by running `diff` and always avoid writing the
patches manually as it's very easy to get them wrong.

once that is done, uncomment the patch lines in `scripts/prepare_asar` and run

```bash
mv scratch scratch-patched-inplace
rm -rf scratch
DEV=1 nix develop --command yarn run prepare:asar
```

then diff `./scratch-patched-inplace` with the resulting `./scratch` to validate
the patches were applied as expected.

## validation

to validate things are still working, we'll first validate the server, then the
client. before starting this step, make sure to wait for the
`upgrading the codex-cli version` subagent to finish.

to validate the server, run the following

```bash
nix develop --command yarn server
```

next validate the client by opening a browser window to `http://localhost:8214`
and validating things show up on the page.

look in the console for errors. also, look on the screen to see whether any
error dialogs popped up. sometimes errors occur, but they're silent and exhibit
as loading taking forever (more than 1m). look out for that case too.

if there are errors, bring them to the users attention and we will decide how to
proceed.
